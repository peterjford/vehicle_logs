# vehicle_logs
Log vehicle information, fuel, maint, repair, etc.

I do most of my vehicles maintenance and repairs myself and like to keep track of what was done, how much it cost, and when maintenace is due again.

This was a procedural/functional php application, but I wanted to update it to OOP. Right after I started this the new PHP frameworks became popular so I was going to use one of them (probably Laravel), but at the same time JavaScript grew up so I started learning nodejs and express and never came back to this.
